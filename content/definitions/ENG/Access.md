“Authorized access”, “user access” or “access” refers to the permission to use a protected system or application to create, read, update, and delete information. Access includes the processes and tools by which users request and are granted or denied the rights (or entitlements) to access protected resources with a possible grouping of entitlements into roles. The subcomponents related to the management of accounts and rights reflect the lifecycle phases associated with access management.
