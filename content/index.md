# # Intro

Hi, there 👋. My name is Farhat Aghayev. I am an **ITSM / GRC Professional** deeply interested in helping people interface more easily with specified topics.

# # Navigation

There are multiple ways to navigate in my lab:

1. Use the search bar on the top right or press `ctrl+k` ( `cmd+k` on Mac) or click on the Search button (top right) to search for any term.
2. Click on a note to explore its content, and follow the links and backlinks to dive deeper into related topics.
3. Interact with the graph at the bottom of the page to visualize connections between notes and click on any node to navigate directly to that note.
