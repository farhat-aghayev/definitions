# definitions
Repository designed to serve as a centralized knowledge hub, storing definitions of terms in the popular Obsidian Markdown format

- ISO27001 contains all definitions of terms from the standard (version 2022)
- ENG is definitions of terms (different sources, mostly from ITIL) which I use in documents
- AZE is a translation of terms located in the ENG section into the Azerbaijani language
